# Fontchido
Fontchido is an alternative to some fonts providers for web design/development.
Fontchido uses a custom font called fontchido.ttf, this let us create our own logotypes as a font.

In order to edit or add your logotype to be a part of the fontchido project, you need fontforge(https://fontforge.github.io/en-US/) to edit the font, the fontchido.sfd file, contains the data of each logo. 
I started this project because I needed some logotypes that fontawesome does not have, or are still on unavailable and because there are some people asking for logotypes they need. Of course, for now this project does not have a lot icons. 

# How to use it:

1. Clone the repo
```console
foo@bar:~$ git clone 
```
2. Call the .css in your html file
```html
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/fontchido.css"></head>
```

3. Call your icon like the following example:
```html
	<span class="ic-archlinux"></span>
```

**NOTE:** If you have an special need about the style of your logo, you can change the size in the fontchido.css file with 'font-size: ;',
alternatively you can do it like this:
```html
    <span class="ic-archlinux" style="color: ; font-size: ; /* etc...*/"></span>
```
	
checking the style on the .css file to avoid conflicts.
